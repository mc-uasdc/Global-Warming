        <h1>Global warming</h1>
        <p>Global warming is an issue that everyone on this planet has been facing. Science has proven that we are primary cause of Global Warming.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/global-warming/">Global warming</a> is-a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.</p>

        <p>We are the cause of it, so what prevents us from stopping it?
            If we dont do something now then we can face some devastating effects. For example, if we dont do anything to stop global warming then we can expecpt a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/sea-level-rise/">Sea level rise</a> which means that a bunch of islands that people live in can be in risk of getting wiped off the map. For instance Hawaii is one of the islands that are danger of sea level rise.</p>

        <p>One reason why this issue is imortant to me is because, we see what is going on and wet we haven't done anything to prevent it from happening. To add on scientests are telling us what to do to prevent it and people who do have a chance to donate alot of money (rich people) decide to either donate a little or donate nothing </p>

        <p>If you are a person who would like to donate to help prevent global warming from continuing then i would suggest donating to <a href="https://membership.onlineaction.org/site/Donation2?df_id=18816&18816.donation=form1&addl_info=nav-button&conversion_pg=www.edf.org%2Ffight-global-warming&_ga=2.168314850.2144629043.1571316112-963769011.1571316112">EDF</a> or <a href="https://act.nrdc.org/donate/one-time/?locsrc=nr-glb-nav-btn&source=WEBMEM&_ga=2.55955759.565034263.1571316356-719310313.1571316356">NRDC</a></p>
